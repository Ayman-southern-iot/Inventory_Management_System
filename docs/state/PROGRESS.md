## Current position

- **Phase:** 06 — Hardening (in progress). Phase 04's BOM module and Phase 06's audit module both
  exist in the working tree; neither has been committed, and neither has passed a green test run.
- **Next task:** get the tree back to green, in this order — (1) start Docker Desktop,
  (2) `pnpm db:migrate` to apply `0012_audit_retention`, then `pnpm db:rollback && pnpm db:migrate`
  to rollback-verify it, (3) `pnpm --filter @ims/api test:int > /tmp/int.log 2>&1` and work the
  **5 known failures**. Only then commit.
- **Working tree:** ⚠️ **dirty and uncommitted — roughly 84 files.** It carries the BOM module, the
  audit module, migrations 0011 and 0012, and a large cross-cutting concurrency/security fix pass
  from 2026-07-30. `pnpm typecheck` passes. `pnpm --filter @ims/api test:int` does **not**.
  Delete the untracked scratch file `apps/api/test_audit5.mjs` (hardcoded test-DB password) before
  any `git add .`.
- **Blocked by:** nothing external. OQ-14 and OQ-15 (always-on audit actions; whether the purge
  should default to a retention period) are recorded assumptions, not hard blocks.
- **Security review:** the 2026-07-30 pass found **one CRITICAL, three HIGH** in code written
  since the Phase 00 review — a SQL injection through `sql.lit` in the audit insert, a
  client-controlled `X-Forwarded-For` that could roll back every audited mutation, unguarded BOM
  read endpoints, and authentication coupled to the audit table. **All four are fixed**, but the
  fixes have **no regression tests yet** and have not been exercised by a green suite. Five further
  gaps are carried as G-11..G-15 in `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`.

## Task detail

Task-level checkboxes live in each `plan/PHASE-NN-*.md`. This table is the summary; the phase file
is the truth. Tick a phase ✅ only after `/verify` passes its exit criteria.

## What exists after Phase 00

**Commands** — `pnpm dev` (api + web), `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`,
`pnpm db:up` (starts dev + test Postgres), `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:rollback`,
`pnpm db:make <name>`, `pnpm db:seed`, `pnpm --filter @ims/api test:int`.

**Ports** — API 3000, web 5173, dev Postgres **5433**, test Postgres **5434**. 5432 and 5430 were
already occupied on the build machine by unrelated stacks; the compose file reflects that.

**Seeded dev logins** (created outside production only) — `admin@ims.local` with the
`SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`, plus `general@`, `im@`, `approver1@`, `approver2@` at
`@ims.local` with `DevPassword123`.

**Schema** — `app_settings`, `departments`, `users`, `user_roles`, `refresh_tokens`,
`login_attempts`, `approver_slots`, and the `user_role` / `refresh_revocation_reason` enums.

**Tests** — 36 API unit, 219 API integration, 22 web component. All green.

**Verified by hand** — migrate → rollback → migrate from empty; the full production compose stack
(`db`, `migrate`, `api`, `web`, `proxy`) coming up on a clean build and serving the SPA and API
through Caddy; each role's navigation in a real browser.

## Environment gotchas on this machine

Not in any config file, and each one has cost a session time at least once:

- **Docker Desktop stops itself between sessions.** Check `docker info` before any migration or
  test run. To start it:
  `powershell -NoProfile -Command "Start-Process 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe' -WindowStyle Hidden"`,
  then wait with `until docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 5; done`, then
  `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env up -d`.
- **Never run `apps/api` through `tsx`.** esbuild does not emit `design:paramtypes`, so NestJS
  resolves every injected dependency to `undefined` and fails far from the cause. Use
  `pnpm --filter @ims/api build && node dist/src/main.js`, or `pnpm dev`. `tsx` is fine for
  `scripts/migrate.ts` and `scripts/seed.ts` — no DI there.
- The full integration run takes ~50s but has exceeded a 600s shell timeout when the database
  was cold. Redirect it to a file and grep the result rather than streaming it.
- Two tables are append-only by trigger — `stock_ledger` and `requisition_events`. Anything that
  would UPDATE or DELETE them fails loudly, **including** a cascade or an `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
  That is why `resetData` leaves stock, requisitions and the users they reference in place.
- **A smoke script that logs in repeatedly will trip its own rate limit.** `/auth/login` is
  capped at 10 per minute per IP. Re-running a script that signs in five users a few times in a
  row returns `429 RATE_LIMITED`, and the resulting `undefined` token then reads as a confusing
  401. Log in once and reuse the token, or wait the window out. The limit is working correctly —
  this is not a bug to "fix".
- Settings changed by hand in the dev database **persist**. A smoke run that leaves the expense
  threshold at 25,000 will make the next run's "two approvers" assertion fail for a legitimate
  reason. Reset it to 15,000, or read the live value rather than assuming it.
